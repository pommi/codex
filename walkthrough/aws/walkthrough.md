## Setup Credentials

So you've got an AWS account right?  Cause otherwise let me interest you in
another guide like our OpenStack, Azure or vSphere, etc.  j/k

To begin, let's login to [Amazon Web Services][aws] and prepare the necessary
credentials and resources needed.

1. Access Key ID
2. Secret Key ID
3. A Name for your VPC
4. An EC2 Key Pair

### Generate Access Key

  The first thing you're going to need is a combination **Access Key ID** /
  **Secret Key ID**.  These are generated (for IAM users) via the IAM dashboard.

  To help keep things isolated, we're going to set up a brand new IAM user.  It's
  a good idea to name this user something like `cf` so that no one tries to
  re-purpose it later, and so that it doesn't get deleted.

1. On the AWS web console, access the IAM service, and click on `Users` in the
sidebar.  Then create a new user and select "Generate an access key for each user".

  **NOTE**: **Make sure you save the secret key somewhere secure**, like 1Password
  or a Vault instance.  Amazon will be unable to give you the **Secret Key ID**
  if you misplace it -- your only recourse at that point is to generate a new
  set of keys and start over.

2. Next, find the `cf` user and click on the username. This should bring up a
summary of the user with things like the _User ARN_, _Groups_, etc.  In the
bottom half of the Summary panel, you can see some tabs, and one of those tabs
is _Permissions_.  Click on that one.

3. Now assign the **PowerUserAccess** role to your user. This user will be able to
do any operation except IAM operations.  You can do this by clicking on the
_Permissions_ tab and then clicking on the _attach policy_ button.

4. We will also need to create a custom user policy in order to create ELBs with
SSL listeners. At the same _Permissions_ tab, expand the _Inline Policies_ and
then create one using the _Custom Policy_ editor. Name it `ServerCertificates`
and paste the following content:

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "iam:DeleteServerCertificate",
                    "iam:UploadServerCertificate",
                    "iam:ListServerCertificates",
                    "iam:GetServerCertificate"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

5. Click on _Apply Policy_ and you will be all set.

### Name Your VPC

This step is really simple -- just make one up.  The VPC name will be used to
prefix certain things that Terraform creates in the AWS Virtual Private Cloud.
When managing multiple VPC's this can help you to sub-select only the ones you're
concerned about.

The VPC is configured in Terraform using the `aws_vpc_name` variable in the
`aws.tfvars` file we're going to create soon.

```
aws_vpc_name = "snw"
```

The prefix of `snw` for Stark & Wayne would show up before VPC components like
Subnets, Network ACLs and Security Groups:

| Name            | ID              |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| snw-dev-infra-0 | subnet-cf7812b9 |
| snw-hardened    | acl-10feff74    |
| snw-dmz         | sg-e0cfcf86     |

### Generate EC2 Key Pair

The **Access Key ID** / **Secret Key ID** are used to get access to the Amazon
Web Services themselves.  In order to properly deploy on EC2 over SSH, we'll need
to create an **EC2 Key Pair**.  This will be used as we bring up the initial NAT
and bastion host instances. And is the SSH key you'll use to connect from your
local machine to the bastion.

**NOTE**: Make sure you are in the correct region (top-right corner of the black
menu bar) when you create your **EC2 Key Pair**. Otherwise, it just plain won't
work. The region name setting can be found in `aws.tf` and the mapping to the
region in the menu bar can be found on [Amazon Region Doc][amazon-region-doc].

1. Starting from the main Amazon Web Console, go to Service > EC2, and then click
the _Key Pairs_ link under _Network & Security_. Look for the big blue
`Create Key Pair` button.

2. This downloads a file matching the name of your **EC2 Key Pair**.  Example,
a key pair named cf-deploy would produce a file named `cf-deploy.pem` and be saved
to your Downloads folder.  Also `chmod 0600` the `*.pem` file.

3. Decide where you want this file to be.  All `*.pem` files are ignored in the
codex repository.  So you can either move this file to the same folder as
`CODEX_ROOT/terraform/aws` or move it to a place you keep SSH keys and use the
full path to the `*.pem` file in your `aws.tfvars` for the `aws_key_file`
variable name.

```
aws_key_file = /Users/<username>/.ssh/cf-deploy.pem
```

## Use Terraform

Once the requirements for AWS are met, we can put it all together and build out
your shiny new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), NAT server and bastion host. Change
to the `terraform/aws` sub-directory of this repository before we begin.

The configuration directly matches the [Network Plan][netplan] for the demo
environment.  When deploying in other environments like production, some tweaks
or rewrites may need to be made.

### Variable File

Create a `aws.tfvars` file with the following configurations (substituting your
actual values) all the other configurations have default setting in the
`CODEX_ROOT/terraform/aws/aws.tf` file.

```
aws_access_key = "..."
aws_secret_key = "..."
aws_vpc_name   = "snw"
aws_key_name   = "cf-deploy"
aws_key_file   = "/Users/<username/.ssh/cf-deploy.pem"
```

If you need to change the region or subnet, you can override the defaults
by adding:

```
aws_region     = "us-east-1"
network        = "10.42"
```

Also, be advised:  Depending on the state of your AWS account, you may also need to explicitly list the AWS Availability Zones as follows:
```
aws_az1        = "a"
aws_az2        = "c"
aws_az3        = "d"
```
Otherwise, you may get the following error:
```
 * aws_subnet.dev-cf-edge-1: Error creating subnet: InvalidParameterValue: Value (us-east-1b) for parameter availabilityZone is invalid. Subnets can currently only be created in the following availability zones: us-east-1c, us-east-1d, us-east-1e, us-east-1a.
    status code: 400, request id:
```
You may change some default settings according to the real cases you are
working on. For example, you can change `instance_type` (default is t2.small)
in `aws.tf` to large size if the bastion would require a high workload.

### Production Considerations

When considering production availability. We recommend [a region with three availability zones][az]
for best HA results.  Vault requires at least three zones.  Please feel free to
list any other software that requires more than two zones for HA.

### Build Resources

As a quick pre-flight check, run `make manifest` to compile your Terraform plan
and suss out any issues with naming, missing variables, configuration, etc.:

```
$ make manifest
terraform get -update
terraform plan -var-file aws.tfvars -out aws.tfplan
Refreshing Terraform state prior to plan...

<snip>

Plan: 129 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If everything worked out you should see a summary of the plan.  If this is the
first time you've done this, all of your changes should be additions.  The
numbers may differ from the above output, and that's okay.

Now, to pull the trigger, run `make deploy`:

```
$ make deploy
```

Terraform will connect to AWS, using your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Key ID**,
and spin up all the things it needs.  When it finishes, you should be left with
a bunch of subnets, configured network ACLs, security groups, routing tables,
a NAT instance (for public internet connectivity) and a bastion host.

If you run into issues before this point refer to our [troubleshooting][troubleshooting]
doc for help.

### Automate Build and Teardown

When working with development environments only, there are options built into
Terraform that will allow you to configure additional variables and then run a
script that will automatically create or destroy the base Terraform environment
for you (a NAT server and a bastion host).  This allows us to help reduce runtime
cost.

Setup the variables of what time (in military time) that you'd like the script's
time range to monitor.

```
startup = "9"
shutdown = "17"
```

With the `startup` and `shutdown` variables configured in the `aws.tfvars` file,
you can then return to the `CODEX_ROOT/terraform/aws` folder and run:

* `make aws-watch`
* `make aws-stopwatch`

The first starts the background process that will be checking if it's time to
begin the teardown.  The second will shutdown the background process.

(( insert_file bastion_intro.md ))
* In the AWS Console, go to Services > EC2.  In the dashboard each of the
**Resources** are listed.  Find the _Running Instances_ click on it and locate
the bastion.  The _Public IP_ is an attribute in the _Description_ tab.

### Connect to Bastion

You'll use the **EC2 Key Pair** `*.pem` file that was stored from the
[Generate EC2 Key Pair](aws.md#generate-ec2-key-pair) step before as your credential
to connect.

In forming the SSH connection command, use the `-i` flag to give SSH the path to
the `IdentityFile`.  The default user on the bastion server is `ubuntu`.  This
will change in a little bit though when we create a new user, so don't get too
comfy.

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/cf-deploy.pem ubuntu@52.43.51.197
```

Problems connecting?  [Verify your SSH fingerprint][verify_ssh] in the
troubleshooting doc.

#### Make Manifest

Let's head into the `proto/` environment directory and see if we
can create a manifest, or (a more likely case) we still have to
provide some critical information:

```
$ cd ~/ops/bosh-deployments/us-west-2/proto
$ make manifest
9 error(s) detected:
 - $.meta.aws.access_key: Please supply an AWS Access Key
 - $.meta.aws.azs.z1: What Availability Zone will BOSH be in?
 - $.meta.aws.region: What AWS region are you going to use?
 - $.meta.aws.secret_key: Please supply an AWS Secret Key
 - $.meta.aws.ssh_key_name: What is your full key name?
 - $.meta.aws.default_sgs: What Security Groups?
 - $.meta.aws.private_key: What is the local path to the Amazon Private Key for this deployment?
 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network
 - $.meta.shield_public_key: Specify the SSH public key from this environment's SHIELD daemon
Availability Zone will BOSH be in?


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
Makefile:22: recipe for target 'manifest' failed
make: *** [manifest] Error 5
```

Drat. Let's focus on the `$.meta` subtree, since that's where most parameters are defined in
Genesis templates:

```
- $.meta.aws.access_key: Please supply an AWS Access Key
- $.meta.aws.azs.z1: What Availability Zone will BOSH be in?
- $.meta.aws.region: What AWS region are you going to use?
- $.meta.aws.secret_key: Please supply an AWS Secret Key
```

This is easy enough to supply.  We'll put these properties in
`properties.yml`:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
    azs:
      z1: (( concat meta.aws.region "a" ))
    access_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:access_key" ))
    secret_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:secret_key" ))
```

I use the `(( concat ... ))` operator to [DRY][DRY] up the
configuration.  This way, if we need to move the BOSH Director to
a different region (for whatever reason) we just change
`meta.aws.region` and the availability zone just tacks on "a".

(We use the "a" availability zone because that's where our subnet
is located.)

I also configured the AWS access and secret keys by pointing
Genesis to the Vault.  Let's go put those credentials in the
Vault:

```
$ safe set secret/us-west-2 access_key secret_key
access_key [hidden]:
access_key [confirm]:

secret_key [hidden]:
secret_key [confirm]:

```

Let's try that `make manifest` again.

```
$ make manifest`
5 error(s) detected:
 - $.meta.aws.default_sgs: What security groups should VMs be placed in, if none are specified in the deployment manifest?
 - $.meta.aws.private_key: What private key will be used for establishing the ssh_tunnel (bosh-init only)?
 - $.meta.aws.ssh_key_name: What AWS keypair should be used for the vcap user?
 - $.meta.shield_public_key: Specify the SSH public key from this environment's SHIELD daemon
 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
Makefile:22: recipe for target 'manifest' failed
make: *** [manifest] Error 5
```

Better. Let's configure our `cloud_provider` for AWS, using our EC2 key pair.
We need copy our EC2 private key to bastion host and path to the key for
`private_key` entry in the following `properties.yml`.


On your local computer, you can copy to the clipboard with the `pbcopy` command
on a macOS machine:

```
cat ~/.ssh/cf-deploy.pem | pbcopy
<paste values to /path/to/the/ec2/key.pem>
```

Then add the following to the `properties.yml` file.

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
    azs:
      z1: (( concat meta.aws.region "a" ))
    access_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:access_key" ))
    secret_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:secret_key" ))
    private_key: /path/to/the/ec2/key.pem
    ssh_key_name: your-ec2-keypair-name
    default_sgs:
      - restricted
```

Once more, with feeling:

```
$ make manifest
2 error(s) detected:
 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network
 - $.meta.shield_public_key: Specify the SSH public key from this environment's SHIELD daemon


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
Makefile:22: recipe for target 'manifest' failed
make: *** [manifest] Error 5
```

Excellent.  We're down to two issues.

(( insert_file proto_bosh_shield_ssh_key.md ))
Now, we should have only a single error left when we `make
manifest`:

```
$ make manifest
1 error(s) detected:
 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
Makefile:22: recipe for target 'manifest' failed
make: *** [manifest] Error 5
```

So it's down to networking.

Refer back to your [Network Plan][netplan], and find the `global-infra-0`
subnet for the proto-BOSH in the AWS Console.  If you're using the plan in this
repository, that would be `10.4.1.0/24`, and we're allocating
`10.4.1.0/28` to our BOSH Director.  Our `networking.yml` file,
then, should look like this:

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
networks:
  - name: default
    subnets:
      - range:    10.4.1.0/24
        gateway:  10.4.1.1
        dns:     [10.4.0.2]
        cloud_properties:
          subnet: subnet-xxxxxxxx # <-- your AWS Subnet ID
          security_groups: [wide-open]
        reserved:
          - 10.4.1.2 - 10.4.1.3    # Amazon reserves these
            # proto-BOSH is in 10.4.1.0/28
          - 10.4.1.16 - 10.4.1.254 # Allocated to other deployments
        static:
          - 10.4.1.4
```

Our range is that of the actual subnet we are in, `10.4.1.0/24`
(in reality, the `/28` allocation is merely a tool of bookkeeping
that simplifies ACLs and firewall configuration).  As such, our
Amazon-provided default gateway is 10.4.1.1 (the first available
IP) and our DNS server is 10.4.0.2.

We identify our AWS-specific configuration under
`cloud_properties`, by calling out what AWS Subnet we want the EC2
instance to be placed in, and what EC2 Security Groups it should
be subject to.

Under the `reserved` block, we reserve the IPs that Amazon
reserves for its own use (see [Amazon's documentation][aws-subnets],
specifically the "Subnet sizing" section), and everything outside of
`10.4.1.0/28` (that is, `10.4.1.16` and above).

Finally, in `static` we reserve the first usable IP (`10.4.1.4`)
as static.  This will be assigned to our `bosh/0` director VM.

(( insert_file proto_vault_intro.md ))
```
$ cd ~/ops/vault-deployments/us-west-2/proto

```

Vault is pretty self-contained, and doesn't have any secrets of
its own.  All you have to supply is your network configuration,
and any IaaS settings.

Referring back to our [Network Plan][netplan] again, we
find that Vault should be striped across three zone-isolated
networks:

  - **10.4.1.16/28** in zone 1 (a)
  - **10.4.2.16/28** in zone 2 (b)
  - **10.4.3.16/28** in zone 3 (c)

First, lets do our AWS-specific region/zone configuration, along with our Vault HA fully-qualified domain name:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
    azs:
      z1: (( concat meta.aws.region "a" ))
      z2: (( concat meta.aws.region "b" ))
      z3: (( concat meta.aws.region "c" ))
properties:
  vault:
    ha:
      domain: 10.4.1.16
```

Our `/28` ranges are actually in their corresponding `/24` ranges
because the `/28`'s are (again) just for bookkeeping and ACL
simplification.  That leaves us with this for our
`networking.yml`:

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
networks:
  - name: vault_z1
    subnets:
      - range:    10.4.1.0/24
        gateway:  10.4.1.1
        dns:     [10.4.0.2]
        cloud_properties:
          subnet: subnet-xxxxxxxx  # <--- your AWS Subnet ID
          security_groups: [wide-open]
        reserved:
          - 10.4.1.2 - 10.4.1.3    # Amazon reserves these
          - 10.4.1.4 - 10.4.1.15   # Allocated to other deployments
            # Vault (z1) is in 10.4.1.16/28
          - 10.4.1.32 - 10.4.1.254 # Allocated to other deployments
        static:
          - 10.4.1.16 - 10.4.1.18

  - name: vault_z2
    subnets:
      - range:    10.4.2.0/24
        gateway:  10.4.2.1
        dns:     [10.4.2.2]
        cloud_properties:
          subnet: subnet-yyyyyyyy  # <--- your AWS Subnet ID
          security_groups: [wide-open]
        reserved:
          - 10.4.2.2 - 10.4.2.3    # Amazon reserves these
          - 10.4.2.4 - 10.4.2.15   # Allocated to other deployments
            # Vault (z2) is in 10.4.2.16/28
          - 10.4.2.32 - 10.4.2.254 # Allocated to other deployments
        static:
          - 10.4.2.16 - 10.4.2.18

  - name: vault_z3
    subnets:
      - range:    10.4.3.0/24
        gateway:  10.4.3.1
        dns:     [10.4.3.2]
        cloud_properties:
          subnet: subnet-zzzzzzzz  # <--- your AWS Subnet ID
          security_groups: [wide-open]
        reserved:
          - 10.4.3.2 - 10.4.3.3    # Amazon reserves these
          - 10.4.3.4 - 10.4.3.15   # Allocated to other deployments
            # Vault (z3) is in 10.4.3.16/28
          - 10.4.3.32 - 10.4.3.254 # Allocated to other deployments
        static:
          - 10.4.3.16 - 10.4.3.18
```

That's a ton of configuration, but when you break it down it's not
all that bad.  We're defining three separate networks (one for
each of the three availability zones).  Each network has a unique
AWS Subnet ID, but they share the same EC2 Security Groups, since
we want uniform access control across the board.

The most difficult part of this configuration is getting the
reserved ranges and static ranges correct, and self-consistent
with the network range / gateway / DNS settings.  This is a bit
easier since our network plan allocates a different `/24` to each
zone network, meaning that only the third octet has to change from
zone to zone (x.x.1.x for zone 1, x.x.2.x for zone 2, etc.)

### Setting up AWS S3 For Backup Archives

To help keep things isolated, we're going to set up a brand new
IAM user just for backup archive storage.  It's a good idea to
name this user something like `backup` or `shield-backup` so that
no one tries to re-purpose it later, and so that it doesn't get
deleted. We also need to generate an access key for this user and store those credentials in the Vault:

```
$ safe set secret/us-west-2/proto/shield/aws access_key secret_key
access_key [hidden]:
access_key [confirm]:

secret_key [hidden]:
secret_key [confirm]:
```

You're also going to want to provision a dedicated S3 bucket to
store archives in, and name it something descriptive, like
`codex-backups`.

Since the generic S3 bucket policy is a little open (and we don't
want random people reading through our backups), we're going to
want to create our own policy. Go to the IAM user you just created, click
`permissions`, then click the blue button with `Create User Policy`, paste the
following policy and modify accordingly, click `Validate Policy` and apply the
policy afterwards.


```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect"   : "Allow",
      "Action"   : "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxxxxxxx:user/zzzzz"
    },
    {
      "Effect"   : "Allow",
      "Action"   : "s3:*",
      "Resource" : [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

(( insert_file shield_setup.md ))
Next, we `make manifest` and see what we need to fill in.
```
$ make manifest
5 error(s) detected:
 - $.compilation.cloud_properties.availability_zone: What availability zone is SHIELD deployed to?
 - $.meta.az: What availability zone is SHIELD deployed to?

```

By now, this should be old hat.  According to the [Network
Plan][netplan], the SHIELD deployment belongs in the
**10.4.1.32/28** network, in zone 1 (a).  Let's put that
information into `properties.yml`:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  az: us-west-2a
```

As we found with Vault, the `/28` range is actually in it's outer
`/24` range, since we're just using the `/28` subdivision for
convenience.

```
$ cat networking.yml

Now let's make the manifest.

```
$ cd ~/ops/bolo-deployments/us-west-2/proto
$ make manifest

2 error(s) detected:
 - $.meta.az: What availability zone is Bolo deployed to?
 - $.networks.bolo.subnets: Specify your bolo subnet

Failed to merge templates; bailing...
Makefile:22: recipe for target 'manifest' failed
make: *** [manifest] Error 5
```

From the error message, we need to configure the following things for an AWS deployment of
bolo:

- Availability Zone (via `meta.az`)
- Networking configuration

According to the [Network Plan][netplan], the bolo deployment belongs in the
**10.4.1.64/28** network, in zone 1 (a). Let's configure the availability zone in `properties.yml`:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  region: us-west-2
  az: (( concat meta.region "a" ))
```

Since `10.4.1.64/28` is subdivision of the `10.4.1.0/24` subnet, we can configure networking as follows.

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
networks:
 - name: bolo

Again starting with Meta lines in `~/ops/concourse-deployments/us-west-2/proto`:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  availability_zone: "us-west-2a"   # Set this to match your first zone "aws_az1"
  external_url: "https://ci.x.x.x.x.sslip.io"  # Set as Elastic IP address of the bastion host to allow testing via SSH tunnel
  ssl_pem: ~
  #  ssl_pem: (( vault meta.vault_prefix "/web_ui:pem" ))
  shield_authorized_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2/proto/shield/keys/core:public" ))
```

Be sure to replace the x.x.x.x in the external_url above with the Elastic IP address of the bastion host.

The `~` means we won't use SSL certs for now.  If you have proper certs or want to use self signed you can add them to vault under the `web_ui:pem` key

For networking, we put this inside `proto` environment level.

Makefile:25: recipe for target 'deploy' failed
make: *** [deploy] Error 3
```

Looks like we only have a handful of parameters to update, all related to
networking, so lets fill out our `networking.yml`, after consulting the
[Network Plan][netplan] to find our global infrastructure network and the AWS
console to find our subnet ID:

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
meta:
  net:
    subnet: subnet-xxxxx # <--- your subnet ID here
    security_groups: [wide-open]
    range: 10.4.1.0/24
    gateway: 10.4.1.1
    dns: [10.4.0.2]
```

Since there are a bunch of other deployments on the infrastructure network, we should take care
to reserve the correct static + reserved IPs, so that we don't conflict with other deployments. Fortunately
that data can be referenced in the [Global Infrastructure IP Allocation section][infra-ips] of the Network Plan:

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
meta:
  net:
    subnet: subnet-xxxxx # <--- your subnet ID here
    security_groups: [wide-open]
    range: 10.4.1.0/24
    gateway: 10.4.1.1
    static: [10.4.1.80]
    reserved: [10.4.1.2 - 10.4.1.79, 10.4.1.96 - 10.4.1.255]
    dns: [10.4.0.2]
```

Lastly, we will need to add port-forwarding rules, so that things outside the bosh-lite can talk to its services.
Since we know we will be deploying Cloud Foundry, let's add rules for it:

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  aws:
    azs:
      z1: us-west-2a
  port_forwarding_rules:
  - internal_ip: 10.244.0.34
    internal_port: 80
    external_port: 80
  - internal_ip: 10.244.0.34
    internal_port: 443
    external_port: 443
```

(( insert_file alpha_boshlite_deploy.md ))

**NOTE**: If deploying a bosh-release (BOSH in this case) fails from the proto-BOSH to a child environment (different subnet), you might be having [this issue](https://github.com/starkandwayne/codex/issues/64) with a too strict AWS Network ACL (`<vpc name>-hardened`). BOSH will fail with errors such as: `Error 450002: Timed out pinging to ... after 600 seconds`.

(( insert_file alpha_boshlite_target.md ))
(( insert_file alpha_cf.md ))
(( insert_file beta_bosh_intro.md ))
Let's try to deploy now, and see what information still needs to be resolved:

```
$ cd us-west-2/staging
$ make deploy
9 error(s) detected:
 - $.meta.aws.access_key: Please supply an AWS Access Key
 - $.meta.aws.azs.z1: What Availability Zone will BOSH be in?

 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
make: *** [deploy] Error 3
```

Looks like we need to provide the same type of data as we did for **proto-BOSH**. Lets fill in the basic properties:

```
$ cat > properties.yml <<EOF
---
meta:
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
    azs:
      z1: (( concat meta.aws.region "a" ))
    access_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:access_key" ))
    secret_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:secret_key" ))
    private_key: ~ # not needed, since not using bosh-lite
    ssh_key_name: your-ec2-keypair-name
    default_sgs: [wide-open]
  shield_public_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2/proto/shield/keys/core:public" ))
EOF
```

This was a bit easier than it was for **proto-BOSH**, since our SHIELD public key exists now, and our
AWS keys are already in Vault.

Verifying our changes worked, we see that we only need to provide networking configuration at this point:

```
make deploy
$ make deploy
1 error(s) detected:
 - $.networks.default.subnets: Specify subnets for your BOSH vm's network


Failed to merge templates; bailing...
make: *** [deploy] Error 3

```

All that remains is filling in our networking details, so lets go consult our [Network Plan](https://github.com/starkandwayne/codex/blob/master/network.md). We will place the BOSH Director in the staging site's infrastructure network, in the first AZ we have defined (subnet name `staging-infra-0`, CIDR `10.4.32.0/24`). To do that, we'll need to update `networking.yml`:

```
$ cat > networking.yml <<EOF
---
networks:
  - name: default
    subnets:
      - range:    10.4.32.0/24
        gateway:  10.4.32.1
        dns:     [10.4.0.2]
        cloud_properties:

          security_groups: [wide-open]
        reserved:
          - 10.4.32.2 - 10.4.32.3    # Amazon reserves these
            # BOSH is in 10.4.32.0/28
          - 10.4.32.16 - 10.4.32.254 # Allocated to other deployments
        static:
          - 10.4.32.4
EOF
```

(( insert_file beta_bosh_deploy.md ))
(( insert_file beta_jumpbox.md ))
(( insert_file beta_cf_intro.md ))
As you might have guessed, the next step will be to see what parameters we need to fill in:

```
$ cd us-west-2/staging
$ make manifest
```

```

Oh boy. That's a lot. Cloud Foundry must be complicated. Looks like a lot of the fog_connection properties are all duplicates though, so lets fill out `properties.yml` with those (no need to create the blobstore S3 buckets yourself):

```
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  skip_ssl_validation: true
  cf:
    blobstore_config:
      fog_connection:
        aws_access_key_id: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:access_key" ))
        aws_secret_access_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:secret_key" ))
        region: us-west-2
```

##### Setup RDS Database

Next, lets tackle the database situation. We will need to create RDS instances for the `uaadb`, `ccdb` and `diegodb`, but first we need to generate a password for the RDS instances:

```
$ safe gen 40 secret/us-west-2/staging/cf/rds password
$ safe get secret/us-west-2/staging/cf/rds
--- # secret/us-west-2/staging/rds
password: pqzTtCTz7u32Z8nVlmvPotxHsSfTOvawRjnY7jTW
```

Now let's go back to the `terraform/aws` sub-directory of this repository and add to the `aws.tfvars` file the following configurations:

```
aws_rds_staging_enabled = "1"
aws_rds_staging_master_password = "<insert the generated RDS password>"
```

As a quick pre-flight check, run `make manifest` to compile your Terraform plan, a RDS Cluster and 3 RDS Instances should be created:

```
$ make manifest
terraform get -update
terraform plan -var-file aws.tfvars -out aws.tfplan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...

...

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If everything worked out you, deploy the changes:

```
$ make deploy
```

**TODO:** Create the `ccdb`,`uaadb` and `diegodb` databases inside the RDS Instance.

We will manually create uaadb, ccdb and diegodb for now. First, connect to your PostgreSQL database using the following command.

```
psql postgres://cfdbadmin:your_password@your_rds_instance_endpoint:5432/postgres
```

Then run `create database uaadb`, `create database ccdb` and `create database diegodb`. You also need to `create extension citext` on all of your databases.

Now that we have RDS instance and `ccdb`, `uaadb` and `diegodb` databases created inside it, lets refer to them in our `properties.yml` file:

```
cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  skip_ssl_validation: true
  cf:
    blobstore_config:
      fog_connection:
        aws_access_key_id: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:access_key" ))
        aws_secret_access_key: (( vault "secret/us-west-2:secret_key" ))
        region: us-east-1
    ccdb:
      host: "xxxxxx.rds.amazonaws.com" # <- your RDS Instance endpoint
      user: "cfdbadmin"
      pass: (( vault "secret/us-west-2/staging/cf/rds:password" ))
      scheme: postgres
      port: 5432
    uaadb:
      host: "xxxxxx.rds.amazonaws.com" # <- your RDS Instance endpoint
      user: "cfdbadmin"
      pass: (( vault "secret/us-west-2/staging/cf/rds:password" ))
      scheme: postgresql
      port: 5432
    diegodb:
      host: "xxxxxx.rds.amazonaws.com" # <- your RDS Instance endpoint
      user: "cfdbadmin"
      pass: (( vault "secret/us-west-2/staging/cf/rds:password" ))
      scheme: postgres
      port: 5432
properties:
  diego:
    bbs:
      sql:
        db_driver: postgres
        db_connection_string: (( concat "postgres://" meta.cf.diegodb.user ":" meta.cf.diegodb.pass "@" meta.cf.diegodb.host ":" meta.cf.diegodb.port "/" meta.cf.diegodb.dbname ))

```
Here we are using RDS postgres for databases. If you are using RDS mysql, you need to change`scheme` and `port` for `ccdb`,`uaadb` and `diegodb`, `db_driver` and `db_connection_string` for diego configuration above.

(( insert_file beta_cf_cacert.md ))
Now let's go back to the `terraform/aws` sub-directory of this repository and add to the `aws.tfvars` file the following configurations:

As a quick pre-flight check, run `make manifest` to compile your Terraform plan. If everything worked out you, deploy the changes:

```
$ make deploy
```

From here we need to configure our domain to point to the ELB. Different clients may use different DNS servers. No matter which DNS server you are using, you will need add two CNAME records, one that maps the domain-name to the CF-ELB endpoint and one that maps the ssh.domain-name to the CF-SSH-ELB endpoint. In this project, we will set up a Route53 as the DNS server. You can log into the AWS Console, create a new _Hosted Zone_ for your domain. Then go back to the `terraform/aws` sub-directory of this repository and add to the `aws.tfvars` file the following configurations:

```
aws_route53_staging_enabled = "1"
aws_route53_staging_hosted_zone_id = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
```

As usual, run `make manifest` to compile your Terraform plan and if everything worked out you, deploy the changes:

```
$ make deploy
```

All of those parameters look like they're networking related. Time to start building out the `networking.yml` file. Since our VPC is `10.4.0.0/16`, Amazon will have provided a DNS server for us at `10.4.0.2`. We can grab the AZs and ELB names from our terraform output, and define our router + cf security groups, without consulting the Network Plan:

```
$ cat networking.yml
---
meta:
  azs:
    z1: us-west-2a
    z2: us-west-2b
    z3: us-west-2c
  dns: [10.4.0.2]
  elbs: [xxxxxx-staging-cf-elb] # <- ELB name
  ssh_elbs: [xxxxxx-staging-cf-ssh-elb] # <- SSH ELB name
  router_security_groups: [wide-open]
  security_groups: [wide-open]
```

Now, we can consult our [Network Plan][netplan] for the subnet information,  cross referencing with terraform output or the AWS console to get the subnet ID:

```
$ cat networking.yml

  azs:
    z1: us-west-2a

Let's see what's left now:

```
$ make deploy
3 error(s) detected:
 - $.properties.cc.security_group_definitions.load_balancer.rules: Specify the rules for allowing access for CF apps to talk to the CF Load Balancer External IPs
 - $.properties.cc.security_group_definitions.services.rules: Specify the rules for allowing access to CF services subnets
 - $.properties.cc.security_group_definitions.user_bosh_deployments.rules: Specify the rules for additional BOSH user services that apps will need to talk to
```

The only bits left are the Cloud Foundry security group definitions (applied to each running app, not the SGs applied to the CF VMs). We add three sets of rules for apps to have access to by default - `load_balancer`, `services`, and `user_bosh_deployments`. The `load_balancer` group should have a rule allowing access to the public IP(s) of the Cloud Foundry installation, so that apps are able to talk to other apps. The `services` group should have rules allowing access to the internal IPs of the services networks (according to our [Network Plan][netplan], `10.4.42.0/24`, `10.4.43.0/24`, `10.4.44.0/24`). The `user_bosh_deployments` is used for any non-CF-services that the apps may need to talk to. In our case, there aren't any, so this can be an empty list.

You may encounter the following error when you are deploying Beta CF.

```
Unknown CPI error 'Unknown' with message 'Your quota allows for 0 more running instance(s). You requested at least 1.
```

Amazon has per-region limits for different types of resources. Check what resource type your failed job is using and request to increase limits for the resource your jobs are failing at. You can log into your Amazon console, go to EC2 services, on the left column click `Limits`, you can click the blue button says `Request limit increase` on the right of each type of resource. It takes less than 30 minutes get limits increase approved through Amazon.
